# Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help install and setup Arch Linux.

## Arch Installation

The `arch-install-laptop.sh` file is for use _inside_ the archlinux.iso live boot USB (TODO: Setup my own ISOs with this pre-included).

TODO: Finish script with mkinitcpio config and systemd-boot installation.

## Post install

Once it is possible to boot into Arch independent of the live boot USB run:

* `sudo init-setup.sh`
* `post-install.sh`
