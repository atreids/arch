# Arch

This repo contains my setup and configuration for Arch Linux.

- `arch-setup/` - Contains docs on installing and setting up a fresh Arch install.
- `config/` - Contains my dotfiles for commonly configured programs such as Hyprland, ZSH, Neovim, Kitty, etc. Replicated in a similar structure as a normal `.config` directory (aside from things like `.zshrc` which would live in $HOME) so that directories can just be symlinked across.
- `gaming.md` and others - setup instructions for configuring Arch for specific use cases.

Disclaimer: This repo is purely a place to store my own setup and configuration. I accept no liability for loss or damages that may occur if you copy this setup.
